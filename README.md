# Amazon-Book-Analysis
This is a simple ML application on Amazon book data. I wrote a webscraper to pull the top books from Amazon over a two-year period (I could've gone futher back). After cleaning up the data I used a KMeans algorithm to detect clusters of the data. 

# Results
The results weren't terribly surprising: the data seem best grouped into three categories. The first category being those viral books that are polarizing (to put it lightly). Think books like Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey. The second category are basically modern classics. Books that are, on whole, just considered good books. And the last category of books is hard to place, but I think it reflects Amazon's own e-book best sellers. These books can often be polarizing like viral books but are less in the public eye than viral books.
